PROBLEMS
adding new agents and players overhead
Sorting


TESTS AND GOOD TINGS FAM
General gpu vs CPU performance
Target data (5000-6000 players, 60,000 agents)
max realistic agents

broadphase gpu vs cpu
broadphase improvement on players not better on agents 1.256ms and 305us


implementation
optermisation
optermisation for parralelism
